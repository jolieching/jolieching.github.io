As the web director of Ka Leo O Hawai'i, I have many responsibilites. Some examples of my everyday tasks include covering daily news, improving the user interface and experience of the <a href="https://manoanow.org/kaleo/">Ka Leo website</a> through the BLOX Content Management System, editing news drafts, and posting and designing web articles. Though I have only been in this position for less than a year, I have already been challenged to improve my communication and time management skills to become a more effective leader. 

To illustrate this, one of Ka Leo's everyday struggles is finding reporters to write articles for the web (we are constantly understaffed). When I first took up the position as web editor, my solution to this problem was writing the majority of the web articles we posted to the site. As one can imagine, this is a lot of ground for one person to cover and I realized I wouldn't be able to keep this pace up during the school year. Because of this, I implemented the web's PLAIO system with all of Ka Leo's desk editors. The web PLAIO is a system in which editors have their writers sign up to do a weekly web article in each department: news, features, opinions, sports. With the implementation of this change, the responsibility of providing web content was delegated to the entire Ka Leo staff, ensuring that we could cover a wider range of stories. It was an organizational change like this that contributed to the development of a more active news website.

Looking towards the future, I hope to continue to improve as a web director for Ka Leo. One of my goals from taking software development courses is learning how to develop websites and how to become an even better team player.
