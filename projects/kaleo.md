As the web director of Ka Leo O Hawai'i, I have many responsibilites, some of which include covering daily news, refining the site's user interface and experience, and posting and designing web articles. Even though I have been in this position for less than a year, I have been challenged to improve my communication and delegation to become a more effective leader. 

One of Ka Leo's everyday struggles is finding reporters to write articles for the web (we are constantly understaffed). First and foremost, it is my job to keep the website updated with daily content on the happenings of anything UH Manoa. As one can imagine, this is a lot of ground for one person to cover. Because of this, I implemented the web PLAIO system in which writers and editors will have to sign up to do a weekly web article in each department: news, features, opinions, sports. In this way, I could get at least five web articles scheduled for a week in addition to our regular print edition. It was organizational changes like this that contributed to the development of a more active website.
