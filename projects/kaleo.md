The Sloth Wall Event Planner is a web application I developed for my Software Engineering II course. It provides a clean UI to schedule and plan events following the RFC 5545 Specification. The events can be outputted as .ics files that can be inserted into your online calendar.

This application was developed by two people -- my classmate and I. We split the work up pretty evenly. While I focused on the UI and UX, my partner focused on the database.
