I have a been a big fan of the legendary franchise, Metal Gear, franchise since the release of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. In my ICS 111, for my final project, I was inspired to create an 8-bit replica of the first ever Metal Gear game.

Due to time constraints, I had to condense the story down into three parts: finding Grey Fox, destruction of Metal Gear, the battle with Big Boss.
