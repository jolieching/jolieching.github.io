In September of last year, I was invited by Humanities Professor and Honors Program Director Vernadette Gonzalez to assist a Masters Candidate in Computer Science from the Laboratory of Advanced Visualizations and Applications in developing a virtual reality digitization of her upcoming book, Detours: A Decolonial Guide to Hawai'i. This anthology, coming in October of this year, is a collection of over 40 stories voicing the history and notable events of Hawai'i from the Native Hawaiian (Kanaka Maoli) perspective. An example of a story within the book is the development of Moloka'i's largest sustainable fish pond (loko i'a), Keawanui fishpond. This is particularly important to Native Hawaiian history and culture because the loko i'a was an important resource for Native Hawaiians and to have one today in modern society, shows a return to Kanaka Maoli ways of life through promoting food sustainability.

The goal of this project was to develop a virtual reality visualization of Moloka'i and the fish pond.

I will be presenting this project at the National Humanities Conference and the National American Indian Science and Engineering Society in October.
