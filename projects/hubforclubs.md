[Hub for Clubs](https://hub-for-clubs.meteorapp.com/#/) is a web application I developed for my software engineering course. I was in charge of the style and the deployment of the site.

This was my first time collaborating using GitHub and with such a large group (four people). Well, four people may not seem like such a large number when you are all working on the same project, committing hundreds of lines of code, it can get hard NOT to step on each other's toes.

Something that surprised me about the software development process is that many of the function you and your group imagine for your project do not end up in the resulting product. Perhaps on paper, it seemed like a good idea at the time or perhaps you simply couldn't find a way to code the function itself. Regardless of the reason why
