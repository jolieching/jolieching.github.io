[Hub for Clubs](https://hub-for-clubs.meteorapp.com/#/) is a web application I developed for my software engineering course. It is a centralized directory of all registered clubs at UH Manoa and allows its users to find clubs that match their interests. I was in charge of the style and the deployment of the site.

This was my first time collaborating using GitHub and with such a large group (four people). Well, four people may not seem like such a large number when you are all working on the same project, committing hundreds of lines of code, it can become challenging NOT to step on each other's toes. Fortunately, however, it mutually encouraged us to stay in communication with each other and regularly check our group chat.

The biggest difference between group and individual projects is the fact that in the former, you are meshing several brain powers together. The way in which a person codes are as unique as their writing styles. Of course, there are coding standards to help mitigate this. But even so, when the code is coming from someone else with little to no documentation, your brain can take a while to process minor things such as small syntactical differences (I will never understand the people who put their starting and ending curly braces on the same line) or very significant things such as the way the function itself was built. That is why proper documentation and coding standards are so important even if they do seem like an unnecessary effort. Having your work be readable is just as important as getting the function to work. And if I had to choose between the two, I would prefer the former because when something breaks or is broken, you can rely on help from your team members.
