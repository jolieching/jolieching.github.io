After spending several months in my first 300-level computer science course, it's safe to say that I'm no longer a new programmer. Of course, new is subjective, but it seems that with every semester, I learned exponentially more, refining my code and its efficiency in the process. Besides the obvious of having learned (or at least having practiced considering there is only so much a four-month-long course can cover) JavaScript, UI Frameworks, Coding Standards, and Agile project management, I learned many other things in the process.

## There is no shame in working in small incremement

It is my nature to take on large projects and driven by a burst of passion, to work on them for extended amounts of time. I am a person who cannot see the forest for the trees and prefer to work on things until they are 100% done. If things are not 100% done, I feel unaccomplished. For example, for a final computer science project in which I built a [Metal Gear replica](https://jolieching.github.io/projects/metalgearsolid), I experienced my first college all-nighter. Several, in fact. The high investment did, however, return high rewards. But at what cost? After having stayed up a consecutive 48 hours to ensure my group's win, I was utterly burnt out. 

I tried to be more mindful of this tendency, especially for my sophomore year. With that being said, the issue-driven project management style hit home for me. For those unfamiliar with this project management style, it is essentially a method to divide a big project into manageable tasks. It made my life so much easier. Everytime I closed an issue, I felt a sense of accomplishment that encouraged me to continue working on the project. At the same time, however, I also 

With that being said, I have also found an alternative to the GitHub milestone boards: an app called Trello.
