## Idea 1: Overview

The Problem: Many UH students run solo and are not running to their full potential. 

The Solution: This app seeks to foster a more collaborative group-based running environment by helping users to coordinate their route. By running in groups, users are encouraged to push each other further. 

## Idea 1: Approach

The app will look and function as a calendar where users are able to create a running profile (sorted by experience and further sorted by standard 5k times for more experienced runners). Once a profile is created, users can search and view user-made events and can also create events (with routes, time, and location) for other users to see. 

## Idea 1: Use case ideas

New users go to landing page>>click on profile icon>>set up a profile.
Once users have created a profile, they can go back to landing page>>calendar on the running page>>add event or join event.
Admin goes to landing page>>profile login>>edit site

## Idea 1: Beyond the basics

Notifications of new events, user messaging system, reminders, mile tracker, analytics of run (e.g. stride, calories burned), signns up for official marathon events, run/route history, ads for shoes/running gear.
