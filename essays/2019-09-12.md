As a journalist, I ask questions on a daily basis. Asking questions is a pillar of journalism and its what keeps the business alive. Though what is defined as a smart question in journalism may not necessarily be the exact same in computer science, the overall heuristics remain the same. I know I relate back to my journalist experiences quite a lot in these essays, but there's no doubt that more than a few aspects of journalism  overlaps with computer science. Whether you’re posing questions to interviewees or to the internet, they all require the same amounts of tact and precision.

## A Good Question 
What comprises a good question? Let's refer to StackOverflow for this. StackOverflow, for those not in the know, is a popular Q&A site for programmers to recieve and give help on various coding issues.

```
I have noticed that there doesn't appear to be a clear explanation of what the this keyword is and how it is correctly (and incorrectly) used in JavaScript on the Stack Overflow site.
I have witnessed some very strange behaviour with it and have failed to understand why it has occurred.
How does this work and when should it be used?
```
Take <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3127429/how-does-the-this-keyword-work">this developer's question</a>, asking for clarification on the uses of the “this” keyword in Javascript. He first starts his question with a statement addressing that he . This is a simple, general question for a wide range of audience. In fact, about 385k people have viewed this question at the time of this writing, speaking to how general and useful it is to a good amount of Javascript developers?

But how do we go about asking questions that are more specific to the developer?

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example">This person</a> does it well.

In this example, the asker clearly formats his code and his outputs, delineating each with a colored box. He directly compares what his code outputs and what it is supposed to output. He tries once more to address what is wrong with his code by implementing event listeners and asynchronous code. And only after this, does he go to the internet for help. What an exemplary smart question!

The clear goal of this question recieved various detailed responses complete with breakdowns of the original poster’s code, suggestions, diagrams and example code.

## A Bad Question

Now, what does a bad smart question look like?
```
The function should return how many times the string contains one "B", one "A", two "L", two "O" and one "N".
e.g: BAONXXOLL returns 1. BAOOLLNNOLOLGBAX returns 2
```
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57915252/javascript-from-a-string-i-want-to-know-how-many-times-one-b-one-a-two">This question</a> invited (deservedly) scathing answers. One poster even commented:
```
“What have you tried? What went wrong when you tried? Did you attempt to research anything to do with string manipulation? 
We can assist but generally we like it better if people show they have at least made some serious effort first. Thanks [sic]”
```
It sounds like someone trying to get the internet to do their homework for them. And the commentators could definitely sniff that out. There are many areas where the original poster went wrong, but the main one is that he did not invest any effort into his question whatsoever. It looks like he did not even make an attempt to solve it before going to internet strangers for help. 

## So what’s the difference?

Looking at the difference between these two questions, one thing is clear: the though you put towards your question comes back to you in the end. For the most part, the quality of the responses reflect the clarity of a question. As I progress through my computer science career, I will remember to never take advantage of the generosity of the internet.
