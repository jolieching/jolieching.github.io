As a journalist, I ask questions on a daily basis. One of the pillars of journalism is asking smart questions and its what keeps the business alive. I know I relate back to my journalism experiences quite a lot in these essays, but there's no doubt that more than a few aspects of journalism overlap with computer science. Like asking a good question, for example. Whether you’re posing questions to interviewees or to the internet, the heuristics of question-asking remain the same. 

What do I mean by a "good question"? I mean a question guided by the following principles: clarity, precision, and mindfulness of the person on the recieving end of your question. Let's try to find an example of a good question in the wild.

## A Good Question 
I'll refer to StackOverflow for my examples. StackOverflow, for those not in the know, is a popular Q&A site for programmers to recieve and give help on various coding issues.

```
I have noticed that there doesn't appear to be a clear explanation of what the "this" keyword is<br/>
and how it is correctly (and incorrectly) used in JavaScript on the Stack Overflow site.
I have witnessed some very strange behaviour with it and have failed to understand why it has occurred.
How does "this" work and when should it be used?
```
Take <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3127429/how-does-the-this-keyword-work">this developer's question</a>, for example. He asks for clarification on the uses of the “this” keyword in Javascript. However, what distinguishes his question from the sea of other Javascript questions is that he has put effort into his post. He starts off by saying that he has a question that hasn't been addressed yet in StackOverflow. The goal of the question, to learn what the "this" keyword is, is clear and concise. At the same time, the poster is humble and transparent about his misunderstandings.

Apparently, this question also resonated with many people. In fact, about 385k people have viewed this question at the time of this writing, a testament to the fact that even if your question seems basic, there's more likely than not another person looking for the same question.

Now, this was a good example of how to ask questions on genereal computer science concepts. But how do we go about asking questions that are more specific to the individual?

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example">This person</a> does it well.

In this example, the asker clearly formats his code and his outputs, delineating each with a colored box. He explicitly compares what his code outputs and what it is supposed to output. He tries once more to address what is wrong with his code by implementing different methods to find the source of his errors. And only after this, does he go to the internet for help. What an exemplary question-asker!

The responses to this question reflects the success of the original poster's conveyance of his question. The 40+ responses were complete with breakdowns of the the code, suggestions, diagrams and example code.

## A Bad Question

Now, on the flip side, what does a bad question look like?
```
The function should return how many times the string contains one "B", one "A", two "L", two "O" and one "N".
e.g: BAONXXOLL returns 1. BAOOLLNNOLOLGBAX returns 2
```
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57915252/javascript-from-a-string-i-want-to-know-how-many-times-one-b-one-a-two">This question</a> invited (deservedly) scathing answers. One poster even commented:
```
“What have you tried? What went wrong when you tried? Did you attempt to research anything to do with string manipulation? 
We can assist but generally we like it better if people show they have at least made some serious effort first. Thanks [sic]”
```
It sounds like someone trying to get the internet to do their homework for them, especially considering the poster did not even make an attempt to solve it before going to internet strangers for help. There are many areas where the original poster went wrong, but the most glaring area is that he did not invest any effort into his question whatsoever. And as you can see above, the commentators definitely caught onto that.  

## So what’s the difference?

Looking at the difference between the quality of responses of both good and bad questions, one thing is certain: the thought you put towards your question comes back to you in the end. In the majority of cases, you can determine the success of your question by the quality of the responses. As I progress through my computer science career, I will strive to ask smart questions and remember to never take advantage of the generosity of the internet.
