As a journalist, I ask questions on a daily basis. Asking questions is a pillar of journalism and it's what keeps the business alive. Though we all start asking questions pretty much from the time we begin to talk, few realize the practice it takes to ask a good question. 

What do I mean by a "good question"? As both a journalist and programmer, I define a good question by its overall clarity, precision, and mindfulness of the person on the recieving end of your question. I know I relate back to my journalism experiences quite a lot in these essays, but there's no doubt that more than a few aspects of journalism overlap with computer science. Whether you’re posing questions to interviewees or to the internet, the heuristics of question-asking remain the same. 

## A Good Question 
Let's refer to StackOverflow for our first example of a good question. StackOverflow, for those not in the know, is a popular Q&A site for programmers to recieve and give help on various coding issues.

```
I have noticed that there doesn't appear to be a clear explanation of what the "this" keyword is<br/>
and how it is correctly (and incorrectly) used in JavaScript on the Stack Overflow site.
I have witnessed some very strange behaviour with it and have failed to understand why it has occurred.
How does "this" work and when should it be used?
```
Take <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3127429/how-does-the-this-keyword-work">this developer's question</a>, asking for clarification on the uses of the “this” keyword in Javascript. He first starts his question with a statement letting his audience know that he has sought out duplicate questions and was unable to find any. 

Apparently, this question resonated with many people. In fact, about 385k people have viewed this question at the time of this writing, speaking to how useful this general question is to a lot of Javascript developers?

But how do we go about asking questions that are more specific to the individual?

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example">This person</a> does it well.

In this example, the asker clearly formats his code and his outputs, delineating each with a colored box. He directly compares what his code outputs and what it is supposed to output. He tries once more to address what is wrong with his code by implementing event listeners and asynchronous code. And only after this, does he go to the internet for help. What an exemplary question-asker!

The responses to their question reflects the clarity of the post's overall goal. The 40+ responses were complete with breakdowns of the original poster’s code, suggestions, diagrams and example code.

## A Bad Question

Now, what does a bad smart question look like?
```
The function should return how many times the string contains one "B", one "A", two "L", two "O" and one "N".
e.g: BAONXXOLL returns 1. BAOOLLNNOLOLGBAX returns 2
```
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57915252/javascript-from-a-string-i-want-to-know-how-many-times-one-b-one-a-two">This question</a> invited (deservedly) scathing answers. One poster even commented:
```
“What have you tried? What went wrong when you tried? Did you attempt to research anything to do with string manipulation? 
We can assist but generally we like it better if people show they have at least made some serious effort first. Thanks [sic]”
```
It sounds like someone trying to get the internet to do their homework for them, especially considering the poster did not even make an attempt to solve it before going to internet strangers for help. There are many areas where the original poster went wrong, but the main one is that he did not invest any effort into his question whatsoever. And as you can see above, the commentators definitely caught onto that.  

## So what’s the difference?

Looking at the difference between these two questions, one thing is clear: the thought you put towards your question comes back to you in the end. For the most part, the quality of the responses reflect the clarity of a question. As I progress through my computer science career, I will remember to never take advantage of the generosity of the internet.
