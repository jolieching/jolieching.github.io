Javascript, by far, resembles english more closely than any other programming language. Surprisingly, Javascript and I...just clicked. We’re best friends now. As a student who has participated in the journalism business quite extensively, I have never been happier with a programming language more than I am with  Javascript. It just makes sense. Perhaps it’s a little bit early to be saying this, but I’m excited for what the future holds. 

## A Rough Road

Up until this point, I wouldn’t say my computer science journey has exactly been a breeze. I first fell into the rabbit hole that is programming when I was 16 years old. At the time, I was the proud editor-in-chief of my highschool’s newspaper, the Cougar Connection. A subscription to the newspaper was $10 a piece (which is a steal, considering it’s for a full year and on that of that, usually paid for by parents). I created a rudimentary “database” using PHP, mySQL, and HTML/CSS that could organize students by what class they were in. Mind you, we had to deliver newspapers to almost 300 students so this was actually quite useful in cutting down our delivery times. Spurred by that success, I attempted to transfer our print newspaper to the web. So I did what anyone in that age of digital blogging would do -- I started a WordPress website. Now, before you say that’s cheating, I also install WAMP to create child themes (customizations of templates) to personalize the website to our newspaper. Long story short, my experience as a highschool journalist has largely influenced my eagerness to learn more about web development.

## Life Lessons

Now that I’m taking ICS314 and have begun learning the basics of Javascript, I feel more empowered than ever to learn how to code. I think all of us who have taken or are taking ICS 314 understand that the weekly WODs are the most stressful activity in this class. I can really see how confidence and your mental state plays a significant in your success. Luckily, I’m one of those people where panicking makes things sharper and clearer, rather than foggy. During WODs, I take deep breaths and remember what a previous professor once told me: “Mistakes always happen because you’re thinking too far ahead; you have to go one step at a time.” Of course, this isn’t verbatim but it’s a good paraphrasing of what I believe to be the most basic (and also most frequent) mistake in software development and it’s advice that has never failed me before.
