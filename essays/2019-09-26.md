Do you take a shower? Trim your nails? Wash your clothes? If you do any of these at all, then to some extent, you take care of your appearance and that goes for most of us. Though the stereotype for us programmers is that we’re all unhygienic slobs, we do in fact take measures to care for our bodies and our minds. And that may be true for a few of us, but the majority of us do in fact care. There’s no reason why your code should look like the spaghetti you have left on your shirt. Treat your code like your appearance. Take care of it.  

There is one rule the programmer should abide above all and that’s the coding standard. Following a coding standard is paramount -- so much so that there are entire programs dedicated to ensuring the standard. 

Writing code is like handwriting. Each person has their own unique style. Imagine writing a an essay on a single topic in groups with no standard over cleanliness of handwriting or organization. You may find a special few who have neat handwriting and ideas that mesh with yours but more commonly, you find messy handwriting and broken paragraphs. Imagine further that there are double spaces, randomly-placed commas and periods. English grammar be damned. Now further complicate this with not an English essay but a foreign language. Perhaps foreign language is exaggerating it, but coding is somewhere in between English and a foreign language as it requires us programmers to filter the words on the screen and translate them to actual english in order to fully understand how it works.

Most people are focused on the functionality and the technicalities of what they are writing -- few stop to think about how well this can be conveyed to human eyes. While you know what you have written, do others? And one, three, or a week later, will you still remember what you have done and how it works? 

The neatness of your code tells a lot about what kind of programmer you are. Yes, your code may work but are you going the “extra” mile to make sure others can read it? While neat code is (erroneously) referred to as going the extra steps, it’s not so much an extra effort you throw out willy-nilly rather than it is a fundamental step of programming. The collaborative nature of computer science requires it.

Following the coding standard makes everything much easier to read not just for others, but for yourself as well. No one wants to spend ten minutes trying to understand a few lines of code nor do they want to spend a few hours in the process of debugging trying to understand what you wrote. 

Following coding standards, especially with a helper program, does not need to be a monumental task. Practice following them with every code you write. If you find yourself struggling to keep up, remind yourself that you do tedious and dull yet necessary steps your whole life to ensure your well-being. Just like how you brush your teeth, this is just another necessary step.

Take 5 minutes to save yourself hours of trouble.
