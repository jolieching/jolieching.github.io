ESLint reminds me of my mom. They have one thing in common: they are both notorious for nagging. Clean your room. Clean your code. You'd rather not do either of them or at least wait until tomorrow before starting. Nevertheless, you do them anyways because "there are consequences for your actions" as she tells me -- whether that be a grounding or a bad grade. 

I'm sure they'd rather not bother us, but we're all slovenly uncleanly folks so they must do what's best for us, even if it means becoming the enemy in their eyes. Admit it. You don't care about fixing that double space in your code nor do you care about having a dirty room. No, you only care about getting that green checkmark and cleaning only until your mom doesn't nag you anymore. 

One day, we'll be thankful for our mothers and ESLint and realize why they've nagged us so much. The day we leave our mother's embrace and the day ICS 314 is over and we are no longer required to use ESLint, we'll realize it. Because we'll live in messy rooms with a collection of empty water bottles and we'll have code we don't remember how we put together.

## A PSA for all sons and daughters

Dear reader, the next time you see your mom, give her a hug, some flowers, and thank her for all the times she's kept you in line.
