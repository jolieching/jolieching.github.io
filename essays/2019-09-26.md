ESLint reminds me of my mom. They have one thing in common: they are both notorious for nagging. Clean your room. Clean your code. You'd rather not do either of them or at least wait until tomorrow before starting. Nevertheless, you do them anyways because "there are consequences for your actions" as my mom tells me -- whether that be a grounding or a bad grade. 

I'm sure they'd rather not bother us, but we're slovenly, uncleanly folk so they must do what's best for us, even if it means becoming the enemy in our eyes. Admit it. You don't care about fixing that double space in your code nor do you care about living in a clean room. No, you only care about fixing your code to get that green checkmark and hiding the junk on your floor under your bed to trick your mom into thinking you actually cleaned your room.

One day, we'll realize that our mothers and ESLint were right all along and realize why they've nagged us so much. The day we leave our mother's embrace and the day ICS 314 is over and we are no longer required to use ESLint, we'll realize it. Because we'll live in messy rooms with a collection of empty water bottles and we'll have code we don't remember how we put together.

But! This is an intervention! Hopefully, you won't have to get to that point. I can't tell you how to clean your room or how to get your mom to nag you less. But I can tell you about how and why ESLint is the greatest nag ever.

Have you ever done group programming? If so, you'll probably resonate with my current plight. In ICS 314, we do pair coding every Tuesdays in which we work with a randomly selected partner to solve a timed problem. Half of the time I've got to do a doubletake on what they've written -- even if our methods are the same. Perhaps they've done i = i + 1 rather than i++. Well, even such a simple change as that can totally throw me off my game. When you've been coding solo for such a long time, it takes a while for you to adjust to a different coding style and all that it entails (different spacing, indentations, function and variable names). 

Programmers, though we are stereotyped as antisocial, work together quite a lot. In fact, most projects are collaborative. The nature of computer science requires it (being that no one person can fulfill multiple programming roles). To make life easier for programmers, we've got to all follow an agreed upon coding standard. So we don't have to take those extra seconds understanding our peers' code and vice versa.

Following coding standards doesn't just benefit your group members. You need to make life easier for yourself in any way you can. Sure, you can remember what you did yesterday. Of all things that computer science is, it is information overload. You would be lucky to hold on to that piece of memory even a day later. But three days from now? A week later? 

You'll thank yourself later when you come back to your code and easily understand it. Your group members or the person who has inherited your code will thank you for it.

The bottom line is: make life easier for yourself and others. Take five minutes and save yourself and others hours of trouble later. 

## A PSA for all sons and daughters

By this point, I've sung all my praises for ESLint and coding standards, though I'm sure there are yet more out there. So if we can praise ESLint for this much nagging, why can't we do the same for our mothers who don't rely on programming to automatically correct us?

Dear reader, be thankful of the people (or programs) who keep you in line and make your life easier. So, the next time you see your mom, give her a hug, some flowers, and thank her for all the times she's nagged you.
